## In this case study, we will be able to build decision tree models using the tree and rpart libraries in R. In addition, we will evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and learn how to save the trained model on the local system. The data reports the patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals at various angles and under various conditions.
